						<h1>
							The Story
						</h1>
						<blockquote>“If you don’t know what you want to achieve in your presentation your audience never will.” - Harvey Diamond
						</blockquote>
					</section>
					<section class="white" data-background="assets/microphone.jpg">
						<h2>What are you going to talk about?</h2>
						<p class="fragment">This is a deceptively simple question, especially for engineers.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="assets/sunset.jpg" class="white">
						<h2>Your technology is like an ocean.</h2>
						<p class="fragment">It's vast and it's got many different facets to it.</p>
						<p class="fragment">It's hard to comprehend without any context.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Your job is to plot a course across for your audience.</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">How will you convince your audience to follow you?</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>How do I plot my course?</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Your topic has <em>layers of meaning</em>, like an onion.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Different people have different layers of understanding.</p>
						<p class="fragment">What's the minimum context that people need to understand?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Finding "the Pain"</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Technical problems (and solutions) are about "the pain".</p>
						<p class="fragment">"The pain" has many forms, but it often translates to lost money and/or time.</p>
						<p class="fragment">What is the issue? <span class="fragment">What are its impacts?</span></p>
						<p class="fragment">Is there a solution? <span class="fragment">How well does it work?</span></p>
						<p class="fragment">What are future applications of your solution?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>It's critical to have a compelling story</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Without it, you'll have a rambling, incoherent presentation.</p>						
						<p class="fragment">If you don't have a story that fits your audience, you're probably "too technical".</p>						
					</section>

						<h1>The Delivery</h1>
						<blockquote>
							“There are always three speeches, for every one you actually gave. The one you practiced, the one you gave, and the one you wish you gave.” – Dale Carnegie
						</blockquote>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What makes a speaker worth listening to?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Genuine interest/knowledge in topic.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Upbeat, energetic.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Engages the audience.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3 class="fragment">Good news! As an engineer, you've got the first one nailed.</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							Everyone is really good at identifying a bad speaker.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>But how do I become energetic and engaging?</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Practice is important, but it can only get you so far.</p>
						<p class="fragment">What you might need is a paradigm shift.</p>
						<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
							* Practice will only reaffirm whatever it is you have.
							* If you practice to the point that you can parrot, you're not engaging.
							* Practice can actually hurt you, making you inflexible.
							* But practice is the only way to manage this stressful art of presenting, right?
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>You're not presenting.</h2>
						<p class="fragment">You're having a conversation.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Well, what's the difference?</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Conversations are much less stressful <span class="fragment">(after all, you have them every day).</span></p>
						<p class="fragment">They imply a dialogue between you and the audience.</p>
						<p class="fragment">They allow for a great deal of flexibility.</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">If your audience feels like they're conversing with you, they're more likely to buy in.</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>So how do I have a conversation?</h2>
						<p class="fragment">People think in terms of stories, not facts.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The easiest way to start into a conversation is to tell a story.</p>
						<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
							* Facts require a lot of abstracting, whereas a good story is instantly relateable
							* Example of Stephan's ViaSat cloud eng talk.
							* Sound familiar to you?
